  # General Rules
 - This tournament is a **1v1 solo tournament.**
 - The players will first go through **qualifiers**. Then they will play in a **double-elimination bracket**.
 - The Score System used will be **Score V2**.
 - Any player who meets the requirements stated in the restrictions part is allowed to sign up. Since this tournament might aim to get badged some players might be declined by osu staff.
 - Any members of staff apart from **Organizers, Mappoolers and Referees** are allowed to play.
 - Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
 - All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff members as well.
 - Any rule changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the Discord server.

# Stage Regulations
 - There are seven stages in this tournament: Qualifiers, RO32, RO16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals. 
 - Players will be seeded with the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round.
 - The winning condition for each stage is:
   - Round of 32, Round of 16 and Loser's Bracket Round 1: BO9 (win 5 maps)
   - Quarterfinals and Loser's Bracket Round 2 and 3: BO11 (win 6 maps)
   - Semifinals, Finals, Grand Finals and Loser's Bracket Round 4, 5, 6, 7 and Grand Finals: BO13 (win 7 maps)

# Qualifiers Regulations
 - During this round there will be multiple lobbies available at various hours.
 - A private match will be created and players will be invited into the lobby when it's their time. Make sure you're online at this time.
 - There are no warmups.
 - Seeding will be made with the average rank of each player on each map. 
 - Maps will be played twice in a row during the lobby. The best run will be taken into account for the ranking.
 - Only the 32 best players will continue on to the bracket stage. 

# Match Regulations
 - A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. Both players will be invited into the room when it's match time. 
 - If no staff or referee is available the match will be postponed. 
 - If a player is late, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes. 
 - There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly after match time as long as it's within the postponed time. 
 - If neither of both players have joined after 10 minutes the highest seeded player will advance. 
 - The match will be played as TeamVs and ScoreV2 and the name of the room must be: "WTT: (Player 1) vs (Player 2)". 
 - Each player is allowed one warm-up but it must be below 3 minutes, and must be uploaded to the website up to one hour prior to the match's start time. Players will be allowed to send warmups starting from the day schedules release.
 - If a player does not respect the time mentioned in the rule above, they will not have any warm-up for their match.
 - Warm-ups may not be offensive or NSFW (not safe for work).
 - Each player has to ban **one beatmap** from the pool (apart from Tiebreaker). These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any player in the entire match. 
 - Each player will roll with the command "!roll" in the chat. 
 - The player with the highest roll **bans second and picks first**. The player with the lowest roll **bans first and picks second**. 
 - Each player has 2 mins to announce their ban. If they didn't tell the referee by that time the ban will be made with a roll instead. 
 - Beatmap selection will then alternate between each player selecting a beatmap out of the map pool. 
 - Players may pick freely from any bracket. 
 - Players will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a player didn't tell their pick before the end of the timer the map will be picked with a roll. 
 - If a player disconnects between the beatmaps, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at most. This delay can only be applied once. 
 - If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map. 
 - Disconnects within 30 seconds after the beatmap was started allows the map to be replayed. This is only allowed once per player. 
 - If the beatmap ends in a draw the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. If it does end in a tie again, the map will be nullified again, and the player who picked it will have to pick another map.
 - In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9) the tiebreaker is selected. 

# Mappool Instructions
